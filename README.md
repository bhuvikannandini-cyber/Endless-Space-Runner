The Endless Space Runner 
Python and Pygame were used to create the 2D arcade-style endless runner space game Endless Space Runner.
As you fly through deep space as a space explorer, you must avoid asteroids, aliens, black holes, and debris while gathering stars, planets, and treasures to raise your score.
Features: * Collectibles and obstacles created procedurally
* Player movement based on physics; * Collision detection and scoring system; * Game over and restart mechanics; * Visuals with a space theme; * Increasing difficulty over time
 Python, Pygame, and object-oriented programming are the technologies utilized.
 What this project demonstrates
This game shows my understanding of:
- Game loops and real-time systems  
- Sprite handling and collision detection  
- Game logic and difficulty scaling  
- Object-oriented design in Python  
 How to Run
1. Install Python 3.7+
2. Install Pygame
3. Run the game
